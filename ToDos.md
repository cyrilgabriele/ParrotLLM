## Preprocessing
- EDA really explore what is in the data and write a list of what needs to be cleaned
- Implement the list from EDA(now only non-english removal and the eval dataset removel is in there)
## Sample selection
- Choose a smart way to select the training data when parameter is smaller than the trainingset
- define and implement a way to select the best possible data
